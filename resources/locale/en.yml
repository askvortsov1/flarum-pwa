        You must upload at least one logo for your progressive web app to be installable. Please note that all logos must be square; if they are not, they will be resized and possibly stretched.

        There are a number of size options available below. I would recommend trying to upload a logo to as many as you can: this supports more devices.

        Please note that you can upload 1 large logo to inputs for smaller logos. For instance, you can upload a 1000px x 1000px logo to ALL the file inputs below. However, if you try to upload a 50px x 50px logo to the 512x512 input, it will be stretched a lot.

      logo_size_text: Upload a logo which will be scaled to {size} pixels by {size} pixels size.
